This repository contains my CA assignments from the Universal Design and Assistive ICT module, completed during my third year of Computer Science studies at TU Dublin.

# Assignment 1: Wayfinding App Accessibility Audit  

For this assignment, I conducted an accessibility audit of an existing **Wayfinding App (Google Maps)** to evaluate its compliance with Universal Design principles.  

# Key Tasks

- Assessed the app using the Seven Principles of Universal Design, identifying strengths and weaknesses.  
- Proposed an improved wayfinding app with:  
  - Enhanced voice navigation 🎙️  
  - Customizable accessibility settings ⚙️  
  - Multi-sensory feedback (visual, auditory, haptic) 🔔  
  - A simplified UI for better usability 🎨  
  - Real-time wheelchair-accessible route updates ♿  

This redesign ensures inclusivity for users with visual, motor, auditory, and cognitive impairments, enhancing navigation for all.
