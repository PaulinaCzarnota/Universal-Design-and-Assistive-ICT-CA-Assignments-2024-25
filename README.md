This repository contains my CA assignments from the Universal Design and Assistive ICT module, completed during my third year of Computer Science studies at TU Dublin.

# Assignment 1: Wayfinding App Accessibility Audit  

For this assignment, I conducted an accessibility audit of an existing **Wayfinding App (Google Maps)** to evaluate its compliance with Universal Design principles.  

### Key Tasks:

- Assessed the app using the Seven Principles of Universal Design, identifying strengths and weaknesses.  
- Proposed an improved wayfinding app with:  
  - Enhanced voice navigation 
  - Customizable accessibility settings   
  - Multi-sensory feedback (visual, auditory, haptic)
  - A simplified UI for better usability   
  - Real-time wheelchair-accessible route updates   

This redesign ensures inclusivity for users with visual, motor, auditory, and cognitive impairments, enhancing navigation for all.  

# Assignment 2: Web Accessibility Evaluation and Remediation

This assignment evaluated the accessibility of two university websites in line with the **EU Web Accessibility Directive (WAD)** and the upcoming **European Accessibility Act (EAA) 2025**.

### Overview:

#### Part A: Legislation

- Summarized the **WAD**, its enforcement in Ireland, and its impact on public sector websites.
- Explained the **EAA 2025**, focusing on its implications for the ICT industry and private digital services.

#### Part B: Accessibility Evaluation

- **Websites tested:**
  - [TU Dublin Computer Science](https://www.tudublin.ie/explore/schools-and-disciplines/computing-information-technology/computer-science/)
  - [UCD Computer Science](https://www.ucd.ie/cs/)
  
- **Testing methods:**
  - **Manual Evaluation** using keyboard-only navigation, NVDA screen reader, and HTML/ARIA inspection.
  - **Automated Tools**: WAVE, TAW, AChecker, Google Lighthouse.

- **Findings:**
  - Common WCAG 2.1 Level AA issues included: missing alt text, poor contrast, inaccessible forms, broken navigation, vague links, and lack of ARIA roles.
  - Manual testing revealed user experience issues missed by automated tools.

- **Remediation Plans:**
  - Included specific actions for both websites: semantic HTML, ARIA roles, keyboard navigation fixes, visible focus indicators, accessible forms, contrast adjustments, and accessibility statements.

#### Part C: Role of AI/ML in Accessibility

- Discussed how **AI and Machine Learning** improve auditing through:
  - Automated alt text generation
  - Dynamic content testing
  - Continuous compliance monitoring
  - Accessibility simulations
- Emphasized that AI complements but does not replace human-centered evaluation.
